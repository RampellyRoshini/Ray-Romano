      <div id="sub-sec1">
        <h3>JAMIE FLOYD: <span> UPPER WEST SIDE CLASSIC 6</span></h3>
        <p>"Ray Romano rocks. Listen to this: He did a complete GUT on an eight-room wreck in less than 8 weeks. I do not recommend it for anyone. It is CRAZY. But <br>
           we have little kids and we had no choice. Ray Romano and his team got it done! The place is beautiful!"

      <div id="sub-sec2">
        <h3>DONNA AND SCOTT: <span> RESCUED RENOVATION</span></h3>
        <p>"Ray rescued us from a contractor job gone bad. He and his crew are great, neat and real artisans. We recommend him very highly and I bet before we know <br>
           it, there will be another "Everybody loves Raymond," but on HGTV or TLC!"</p>
      </div>

      <div id="sub-sec3">
        <h3>DAVID SIEGEL: <span> DOUBLED THE VALUE</span></h3>
        <p>"Ray added value in ways that other G.C.s can't. Working with him is a pleasure. He more than doubled the value of my apartment through his gut <br>
           renovations. I would recommend him to any person looking to make home improvements."</p>
